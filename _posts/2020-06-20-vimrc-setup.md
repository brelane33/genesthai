## Vim things

Testing out adding a new page.

I setup my .vimrc and added some plugins today to assist with writing posts for this system.

I added NERDTree, vim-airline, vim-fugitive, and vim-markdown.

Seems like all vim-markdown buys you is you can collapse sections of the post,
but I can see where that would be useful.

The other ones seem way more useful.

Also, fixed the fonts in my iTerm2 setup. Had to turn off "Use different font for non ascii text"

Had been struggling with that issue for a while.

Got this thing setup on Windows, too, using WSL and the Windows Terminal. That thing is such a miserable piece of crap. Every solution is somehow disappointing...
